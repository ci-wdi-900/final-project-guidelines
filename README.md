# The Term 1 Final Project And You - How To Succeed At Building An App

### The Process

* You will be submitting a proposal TODAY for an app that will contain a text description of what your app will do, followed by a sketch of at least two interfaces, browser and mobile views. It does not have to be an in-depth sketch or analysis, but this proposal will grow into your README, which is part of your app's grade.
* Your app will be due at the end of the day on Monday.
* You may present your app on Tuesday, but this is voluntary.
* And here is [the grading rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Bjfzv19JBzVPqz_O4x4BbyUlSw3V4axcy6MJSG-ru8/edit?usp=sharing).


### The Minimum

* The app must take in user interaction through the web and allow the user to create, read, update, and delete data of some kind. It must present that data to the user. For example, an app that manages finances might allow you to add money, look at your list of deposits, change a deposit, and remove a deposit record.
* The app must be responsive.


### The Maximum

* Implement some new front-end technologies, like Bootstrap's grid systems or pre-built components, jQuery's improved methods for DOM manipulation, SASS to make your CSS more programmery, etc.
* Hook into a server, whether it's `json-server`-run or on Firebase or through MongoDB. (Those are in definite order of difficulty!)
